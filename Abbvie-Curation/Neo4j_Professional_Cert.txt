Question 1 of 80
To restore a Neo4j instance from a backup, which of the following is accurate?

A) The Neo4j backups are fully functional databases. To use a backup, all you need to do replace your database folder with the backup. Just make sure the database isn't running while replacing the folder.
B) The Neo4j "backup-restore" command will copy the compressed backup archive files and logical logs to the existing instance database folder, replay the transactions, and bring the database back online.
C) Issuing a "restore" command with a timestamp will recover the Neo4j instance up to that particular point in time, before any transactions corrupted the database files.
D) Shut down the current instance, replace the database folder with the backup, and then startup the Neo4j instance in recovery mode so the database is fully recovered.
